_`<item name>`_ _- The name of the item you're trying to forge. Example:_ _`r!tailor winter clothes`_

The `r!tailor` command is used by the Tailor in order to craft clothing from simpler ingredients. 

#### Recipes:

* **Rosewood Style** \[2 Tanned Leather + 5 Cloth\]
* **Highborn Clothes** \[6 Linen + 1 Silk\]
* **Winter Clothes** \[4 Fur + 2 Wool + 2 Tanned Leather\]

#### Additional requirements:

* **Necessary tool:** None
* **Channel:** \#workshops

## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

Some of the Tailor's necessary ingredients can't be produced by other roles, so they will need to be purchased directly from the Market. Alternatively, some can be acquired through trade with Merchant characters, Butchers, and Farmers. The Tailor is free to sell their products to anyone.
