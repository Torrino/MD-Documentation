# Goldsmith üíç

## Description:

The Goldsmith is a very prestigious role in Rosewood's market. They are the people who turn precious metals and stones into fantastic jewelry for the wealthy city elite.

## Mechanics:

```javascript
r!forge <item name>
```

_`<item name>`_ _- The name of the item you're trying to forge. Example:_ _`r!forge gold jewelry`_

Just like every other smith, the Goldsmith uses the `r!forge` command in order to turn simple materials into complex products which can then be used in trading or selling in the Market. This command can only be used in the \#workshops channel, while the Goldsmith has a Hammer equipped.

#### Recipes:

* **Silver Jewelry** \[3 Silver Nuggets\]
* **Gold Jewelry** \[3 Gold Nuggets + 1 Crystal\]
* **Silver Nugget** \[3 Silver Ore\]
* **Gold Nugget** \[3 Gold Ore\]

#### Additional requirements:

* **Channel:** \#workshops
* **Necessary tool:** Hammer
  * **Location:** Primary slot
* **Minimum Stamina:** 50%
  * **Raw Stamina Cost:** 5 ****
* **XP Reward:** 3
  * **XP Reward Cooldown:** 24h
  * **XP Reward While on Cooldown:** 1

## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

The Goldsmith can, of course, decide to buy the materials they need from the Market, and sell their finished product back to it. However, if a user is attempting to maximize their profit, they should consider trading with other users for both materials and products.

Ideally, a Goldsmith will buy Silver, Gold Ore, and Crystals from a Miner. The Goldsmith can then turn those into ingredients for their recipes.

Once they have forged their jewelry, they are free to sell it to any character with enough coin to pay for them. However, this will most likely be very wealthy merchants or nobility. Alternatively, a Goldsmith can earn profit by selling Nuggets to the Market.
