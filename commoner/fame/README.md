# Fame Route

The Fame Route of the Commoner Path is based on using each role's specific command in order to turn stamina/buckles/raw materials into a product that can be legally sold to the market or to other users. These roles are based on real-life medieval equivalents, and all contribute to the market's "ecosystem" where every role has a way to contribute to others, or just itself. The Fame Route roles are accessible by any user with the commoner role.
