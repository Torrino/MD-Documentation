# TailorðŸ‘š

## Description:

A Tailor is someone who fashions clothes for the people of Rosewood out of a plethora of common and exotic materials. Depending on who they serve, they can become very popular within the City.

The `r!tailor` command is used by the Tailor in order to craft clothing from simpler ingredients. 

#### Recipes:

* **Rosewood Style** \[2 Tanned Leather + 5 Cloth\]

## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

Some of the Tailor's necessary ingredients can't be produced by other roles, so they will need to be purchased directly from the Market. Alternatively, some can be acquired through trade with Merchant characters, Butchers, and Farmers. The Tailor is free to sell their products to anyone.
