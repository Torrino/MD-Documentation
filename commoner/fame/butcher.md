## Description:

Butchers are professionals who know how to skin and butcher animals brought by Hunters or by Farmers and turn their corpses into raw meat and materials.

## Mechanics:

```javascript
r!butcher <animal name>
```

_`<animal name>`_ _- The name of the animal corpse you're trying to butcher. Example:_ _`r!butcher rabbit`_

The `r!butcher`command is used by the Butcher in order to successfully gather meat and materials off of hunted or slaughtered animals. You must have the appropriate corpse of the animal in your inventory that you're trying to butcher for materials and meat.

#### Animal Corpses:

* **Slaughtered Pig** \(gives Raw Pork and Leather\)
* **Slaughtered Cow** \(gives Raw Beef/Veal and Leather\)
* **Slaughtered Chicken** \(gives Raw Chicken and Feathers\)
* **Slaughtered Sheep** \(gives Raw Lamb and Wool\)
* **Deer corpse** \(gives Raw Venison and Leather\)
* **Boar corpse** \(gives Raw Boar and Leather\)
* **Rabbit corpse** \(gives Raw Hare and Fur\)
* **Pheasant corpse** \(gives Raw Pheasant and Feathers\)

#### Additional requirements:

* **Necessary tool:** Slaughter Knife
* **Channel:** \#workshops

```javascript
r!tan <amount>
```

_`<amount>`_ _- The name of the animal corpse you're trying to butcher. Example:_ _`r!tan <amount>`_

## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

The Hunter is the only person, besides Knights and Lords, that can hunt in the forest. For their command to work, they need to have an equipped bow/spear \(depending on what they are hunting\). If they are using the bow, they will need a number of arrows in their inventory. If they are using the spear, then it will be used up in the hunt attempt. _The higher the level, the higher the chances that the spear will be dropped instead of lost upon using the `r!hunt`command._ As such, the Hunter will often need to replace their weapons and they can do that through the Market \(Arrows\), or through a Weaponsmith \(Spears\).  
  
Once they have successfully caught an animal, Hunters will be given its corpse in the inventory. This valuable material can then be sold directly to the Market, or to a Butcher player for a higher profit.
