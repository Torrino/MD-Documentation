## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

Tanned Leather is used in the Tailoring of many clothes, and in the Cobbling of most footwear. As such, the Butcher can sell their Tanned Leather to Tailors and Cobblers, or alternatively, they can sell directly to the Market, but for a smaller profit.

Regarding the Butcher's main command, it enables them to purchase hunted or slaughtered animals from Farmers and Hunters, at a discount when compared to the Market, and sell the materials and meat they get from their Butchering. Meat is a valuable food item, and can be sold to other characters for a profit, or to the Market directly.
