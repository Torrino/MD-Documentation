## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

Farmers are the primary source of food for the Market and for other Characters. Since they are the only role which can produce locally-grown food, they have a pivotal role to play in Rosewood. Plus the added fact that they can slaughter their farm animals means they are also he primary source of meat, and other animal-originated materials like leather and feathers.  
  
Farmers have the choice to sell their produce directly to the Market, or to other characters for a notable profit. Ideally, a Farmer would sell their vegetables and grain to any characters, while they should sell Slaughtered Animals to Butchers.
