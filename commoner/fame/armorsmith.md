# Armorsmith üõ°Ô∏è

## Description:

The Armorsmith is famous for turning raw materials into fancy armor and shields for the nobility, and for wealthy commoners. Armorsmiths are generally prestigious within Rosewood.

## Mechanics:

{% code title="\#workshops" %}
```javascript
r!forge <item name>
```
{% endcode %}

_`<item name>`_ _- The name of the item you're trying to forge. Example:_ _`r!forge chain mail`_

Just like every other smith, the Armorsmith uses the `r!forge` command in order to turn simple materials into complex products which can then be used in trading or selling in the Market.

#### Recipes:

| **Item** | Ingredients | Level Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gambeson** | _10 Linen_ | Novice |
| **Brigandine** | _8 Linen + 10 Steel_  | Adept |
| **Chain Mail** | _12 Iron Bars_ | Master |
| **Rosewoodian Plate** | _15 Steel Bars_ | Grandmaster |
| **Heather Shield** | _4 Wood + 2 Iron Bars_ | Apprentice |
| **Round Shield** | _5 Wood + 2 Linen_ | Novice |
| **Kite Shield** | _6 Wood + 2 Steel Bars_ | Grandmaster |

#### Additional requirements:

* **Necessary tool:** Hammer
  * **Location:** Primary slot
  * **Durability cost:** `5`
* **Minimum Stamina:** `50%`
  * **Raw Stamina Cost:** `5`
* **XP Reward:** `3`
  * **XP Reward Cooldown:** `24h`
  * **XP Reward While on Cooldown:** _30% chance at 1XP per `r!forge`_

## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

The Armorsmith can, of course, decide to buy the materials they need from the Market, and sell their finished product back to it. However, if a user is attempting to maximize their profit, they should consider trading with other users for both materials and products.

Ideally, a Goldsmith will buy Iron and Steel Bars from a Blacksmith, and Wood from a Tree Feller. The Armorsmith can then turn those into ingredients for their recipes. The only ingredient that can't be purchased naturally from other characters is Linen, and can only be acquired from the Market.

An Armorsmith's products are best suited for direct sale to other users, and they will usually be of higher social status due to the expensive nature of advanced armors.
