## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

The Merchant has direct access to the most valuable items one could legally acquire through the Market. Merchants must make use of the `r!travel` command in order to acquire different types of shipments which contain varying items, from grain to tilsent. Once they obtain one or more shipments they are free to return to Rosewood and open them in order to discover the contents and then sell them directly to the Market or to other characters.
