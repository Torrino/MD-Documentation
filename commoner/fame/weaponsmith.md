# Weaponsmith ⚔️

## Description:

The Weaponsmith is a well-regarded role by Rosewood's population. They forge the weapons used in everyday and special combat by almost everyone within the City.

## Mechanics:

{% code title="\#workshop" %}
```javascript
r!forge <item name>
```
{% endcode %}

_`<item name>`_ _- The name of the item you're trying to forge. Example:_ _`r!forge arming sword`_

Just like every other smith, the Weaponsmith uses the `r!forge` command in order to turn simple materials into complex products which can then be used in trading or selling in the Market.

#### Recipes:

## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

The Weaponsmith can, of course, decide to buy the materials they need from the Market, and sell their finished product back to it. However, if a user is attempting to maximize their profit, they should consider trading with other users for both materials and products.

Ideally, a Weaponsmith will buy Iron and Steel Bars from a Blacksmith and Wood from a Tree Feller. The Weaponsmith can then turn those into ingredients for their recipes.

Weapons are a universal commodity in Rosewood and are owned by everyone except perhaps the lowliest of peasants. Some weapons will be better suited for commoners, while others favor nobility, however, there are always exceptions. The weaponsmith, regardless, offers a cheaper alternative for the purchase of weapons.
