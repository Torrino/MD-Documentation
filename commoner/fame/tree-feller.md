# Tree Feller ðŸŒ³

## Description:

Tree Fellers are given the right to cut down trees within the forest of Rosewood, and turn them into wood, that can later be used in construction, or for the production of various tools and weapons.

## Mechanics:

{% code title="\#forest" %}
```javascript
r!cut
```
{% endcode %}

The `r!cut` command is used by the Tree Feller in order to gather wood in their inventory. 

#### Additional requirements:

* **Necessary tool:** Axe
  * **Location:** Primary slot
  * **Durability cost:** `5`
* **Minimum Stamina:** `50%`
  * **Raw Stamina Cost:** `10`
* **XP Reward:** `3`
  * **XP Reward Cooldown:** `24h`
  * **XP Reward While on Cooldown:** _30% chance at 1XP per `r!cut`_

## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

The Tree Feller provides the Market, and character roles like Blacksmiths, Weaponsmiths, Armorsmiths, and Carpenters with the valuable resource of wood. Wood, like many raw materials, can be purchased and sold in the Market, however, it is always more profitable to trade directly with Tree Fellers, both for them, and for the party that requires wood.
