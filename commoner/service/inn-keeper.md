# Innkeeper üóùÔ∏è

## Description:

The Innkeeper of Nan Nicole's is one of the most popular lowborn figures within the Capital. As the Tavern is the most popular one and in the center of the Dunwill Complex, it boasts hundreds of patrons a day. The Innkeeper is chosen directly by the Dunwill House Head to run Nan Nicole's and make sure they are turning a profit each month. For this, they are paid generously and are given the ability/freedom to run the Tavern in any way they see fit. Since they are appointed, Innkeepers can be removed just as easily as they are chosen for the job.

* **Weekly Paycheck:** `50 coin`

## Mechanics:

### Hire

{% code title="Tavern Category" %}
```javascript
r!hire <@user> <role>
```
{% endcode %}

_`<@user>` - The mentioned discord user you want to hire.  
`<role>` - The role they will have once hired. **Accepted options:** `inn hand` , `bard`_

_The only way someone can become a Bard or an Inn Hand is by being hired by the Innkeeper._

{% hint style="warning" %}
There can only be a maximum of **5 Inn Hands** and **5 Bards** at a time.
{% endhint %}

### Fire

{% code title="Tavern Category" %}
```javascript
r!fire <@user>
```
{% endcode %}

_`<@user>` - The mentioned discord user you want to fire.  
Used for firing a user you hired previously from their role._

## In-depth guide:

Being chosen as an Innkeeper means the Creators expect you to be active and administrate a host of inn hands and bards to serve under you, making sure the Tavern category remains as active as possible.

Priests guide deacons, while they are instructed by the Archbishop. They have control over a specific church within Rosewood and are the de facto administrators of the building itself. They inherit all the abilities of Deacons and Scribes but also gain access to new ones since they have been ordained. They can administer all the Holy Sacraments, but cannot ordain, unlike Bishops. They will be often called upon to marry characters and to absolve their sins. Only Rosewoodian Priests can become the next Archbishop of Rosewood. Priests are valued for their knowledge of the Bible, and of Latin. More often than not, wealthy members of society will hire Priests to write official documents for them in Latin, as they are the educated few that know the language. Arguably their biggest task is to deliver the Gospel to the people of Rosewood and teach them the Bible.
