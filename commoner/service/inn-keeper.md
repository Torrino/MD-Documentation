# Inn Keeper 🗝️

## Mechanics

### Hire

{% code title="Tavern Category" %}
```javascript
r!hire <@user> <role>
```
{% endcode %}

_`<@user>` - The mentioned discord user you want to hire.  
`<role>` - The role they will have once hired. **Accepted options:** `inn hand` , `bard`_

_The only way someone can become a Bard or an Inn Hand is by being hired by the Inn keeper._
