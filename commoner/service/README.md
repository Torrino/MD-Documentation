# Service Route

The Service Route of the Commoner Path is based in the Tavern, and their main goal is the entertainment of the Citizens of Rosewood. This can be done through offering accommodations within the Tavern, brewing beer, serving stews, or entertaining the patrons with music. To join the service Route, you must be hired by the Innkeeper.
