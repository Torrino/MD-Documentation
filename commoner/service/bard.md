# Bard ðŸŽ¶

## Description

Bards are the musically gifted citizens of Rosewood who have been hired by the Innkeeper to perform on behalf of Nan Nicole's Tavern. They go around the City and play their songs in key areas to attract listeners, gaining money for themselves, and increasing the Tavern's reputation.

## Mechanics

**You don't level up** as a **Bard** but for **every 10xp**, your income for each playing **increases by 1 buckle**.  
This upgrade is **permanent**.

## In-depth guide

Inn Hands should spend most of their time serving patrons in the Tavern. They work at the bar and normally fetch drinks for the people there. These drinks can be ordinary ones from the Market, however, most patrons will appreciate being served exclusive food/drinks that are only available through the `r!brew` mechanic. These beverages are brewed within the Capital, sold exclusively within Taverns, or shipped elsewhere. For most Inn Hands, a good rule of thumb is to keep your head low, listen to the Innkeeper, and keep out of any criminal activity.
