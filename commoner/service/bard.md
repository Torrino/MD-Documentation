# Bard ðŸŽ¶

## Description:



Inn Hands are employees of the Innkeeper who is charged with running Nan Nicole's. They are lowborn men and women who are handpicked by the Innkeeper. They can be hired and fired whenever and for any reason. Their job consists of making small talk with patrons, serving them various drinks and foods, including homebrewed beers and stews. In addition to this, they also must maintain the Tavern's reputation as well as its hygiene.

## Mechanics:

### Brew

{% code title="Tavern Category" %}
```javascript
r!brew <item_name>
```
{% endcode %}

_`<item_name>` - The food/drink you'd like to create._

#### Brewable Items:

* **`Stew`**
* **`Rosewood Beer`**
* **`Rosewood Mead`**
* **`Rosewood Wine`**

#### Additional requirements:

* **Minimum Stamina:** 50%
  * **Raw Stamina Cost:** `15`
* **Command Cooldown:** `10min`

## In-depth guide:

Inn Hands should spend most of their time serving patrons in the Tavern. They work at the bar and normally fetch drinks for the people there. These drinks can be ordinary ones from the Market, however, most patrons will appreciate being served exclusive food/drinks that are only available through the `r!brew` mechanic. These beverages are brewed within the Capital, sold exclusively within Taverns, or shipped elsewhere. For most Inn Hands, a good rule of thumb is to keep your head low, listen to the Innkeeper, and keep out of any criminal activity.

Your characters plays a song and receives some buckles for it. 

You can use this command with other players when roleplaying and they can give you extra coin for playing songs.

_**Channels:**_ \#shops, \#main\_square, \#great\_hall, \#bar

In order to play in the **\#bar** text channel, you have to be hired as a **Bard** by the Innkeeper. The innkeeper can use the \`hire\` command on you and you'll be officially hired as the Tavern's Bard.   
Playing in the **\#bar** text channel grants you more buckles.   
You don't level up as a Bard but for every 10xp, your income for each playing increases by 1 buckle. 

This upgrade is permanent.
