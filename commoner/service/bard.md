# Bard ðŸŽ¶

## Description

Bards are the musically gifted citizens of Rosewood who have been hired by the Innkeeper to perform on behalf of Nan Nicole's Tavern. They go around the City and play their songs in key areas to attract listeners, gaining money for themselves, and increasing the Tavern's reputation.

## Mechanics

### Play

{% code title="\#shops \| \#main\_square \| \#great\_hall \|\#bar" %}
```javascript
r!play
```
{% endcode %}

_Your characters plays a song and receives some buckles for it. You can use this command with other players when roleplaying and they can give you extra coin for playing songs._

In order to play in the **\#bar** text channel, you have to be hired as a **Bard** by the Innkeeper.   
The innkeeper can use the `hire` command on you and you'll be officially hired as the **Tavern's Bard**.   
  
**You don't level up** as a **Bard** but for **every 10xp**, your income for each playing **increases by 1 buckle**.  
This upgrade is **permanent**.

* **Channels:** \#shops, \#main\_square_,_ \#great\_hall, \#bar
* **Minimum Stamina:** `10%`
  * **Stamina cost:** `5`

_Playing in the **\#bar** text channel grants you **more buckles.**_ 
{% endhint %}

## In-depth guide

If you are a bard without an instrument, your priority should be to get something to play music with. Once you're ready to play, the best way to reach popularity is to simply use the command as much as possible. By playing to more people, you might eventually get noticed by nobility and get invited to a feast where you will earn a lot of buckles for playing. Otherwise, playing in the Tavern is always a good option.
