# Inn Hand üçª

## Description:

Inn Hands are employees of the Innkeeper who is charged with running Nan Nicole's. They are lowborn men and women who are handpicked by the Innkeeper. They can be hired and fired whenever and for any reason. Their job consists of making small talk with patrons, serving them various drinks and foods, including homebrewed beers and stews. In addition to this, they also must maintain the Tavern's reputation as well as its hygiene.

## Mechanics:

### Hire

{% code title="Tavern Category" %}
```javascript
r!hire <@user> <role>
```
{% endcode %}

_`<@user>` - The mentioned discord user you want to hire.  
`<role>` - The role they will have once hired. **Accepted options:** `inn hand` , `bard`_

_The only way someone can become a Bard or an Inn Hand is by being hired by the Innkeeper._

{% hint style="warning" %}
There can only be a maximum of **5 Inn Hands** and **5 Bards** at a time.
{% endhint %}

### Fire

{% code title="Tavern Category" %}
```javascript
r!fire <@user>
```
{% endcode %}

_`<@user>` - The mentioned discord user you want to fire.  
Used for firing a user you hired previously from their role._

## In-depth guide:

Being chosen as an Innkeeper means the Creators expect you to be active and administrate a host of inn hands and bards to serve under you, making sure the Tavern category remains as active as possible. Not hiring any hands or bards will lead to your character losing the Innkeeper role. Therefore, despite having a weekly paycheck, your will still need to RP in the Tavern, and keep track of your Inn Hands, since whatever they do IC reflects negatively on you. Meaning if a problem arises within the Tavern, or involving your employees, it can lead to you getting arrested or fired. It's best to hire people you can trust, or at least avoid those who you know you shouldn't trust.
