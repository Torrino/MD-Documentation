# Thug ðŸ‘Š

## Description:

Thugs are the grunts of any gang within Rosewood. They make sure the day-to-day operations run smoothly and are usually the muscle when it comes to City warfare, be that between gangs, or against the Watch. Their primary source of income is racketeering.

## Mechanics:

{% code title="\#workshops or any residential channel" %}
```javascript
r!racketeer
```
{% endcode %}

`r!rackateer` - _Used to threaten NPC shop owners within the City into paying a monthly "insurance"._

#### Additional requirements:

* **Necessary tool:** Any weapon
* * **Location:** Primary slot
* **Minimum Stamina:** `50%`
  * **Raw Stamina Cost:** `10`
* **XP Reward:** `3`
  * **XP Reward Cooldown:** `24h`
  * **XP Reward While on Cooldown:** _30% chance at 1XP per `r!racketeer`_

## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

Thugs make a living by threatening shop owners and people living in a gang-controlled residential area into paying them insurance money so they might be safe from the gang's violence. This practice is not illegal in and of itself, however, the crime of assault is, and is often used as a legal loophole to punish Thugs from various gangs. Upon a successful racketeer, a Thug will get some buckles.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Characters with the Thug role have a buff during combat against other characters with any role from the Fame Route._
{% endhint %}

If the `r!racketeer` command fails, Thugs will face a -20 HP penalty, which may cause them to be wounded, maimed, or killed. They are considered petty criminals like Thieves and will not be actively hunted by the Watch, like Bandits for example, or other commoners that might have committed a more serious crime.
