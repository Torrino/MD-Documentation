# Infamy Route

The Infamy Route of the Commoner Path is based on using each role's specific command to somehow break the law in order to turn a profit. These roles are based on real-life medieval equivalents, and work both together and against each other. Their main tool is their ability to earn money illegally, slowly turning the character infamous. The Infamy Route roles are accessible by any user with the commoner role.
