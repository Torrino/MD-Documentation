# Smuggler üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Description:

Smugglers use the river in Rosewood to smuggle various goods into the Market. These good range from legal, but cheap, to contraband. All of these can be sold on the Market, Black Market, or to other characters directly.

## Mechanics:

{% code title="\#shops" %}
```javascript
r!smuggle
```
{% endcode %}

`r!smuggle` - _Used to engage with Acer, the best smuggler in the Kingdom, who can give you what you need._

#### _Dialogue options_:

1. `Do you have any goods for me?` _\(You will be given an option to choose some smuggled goods\)_
2. `What can you tell me about this river?` _\(Acer will tell you some lore\)_
3. `Nevermind. Goodbye...` _\(Ends the dialogue\)_

#### Additional requirements:

* **Necessary tool:** None
  * **Location:** None
* **Minimum Stamina:** `10%`
  * **Raw Stamina Cost:** `40`
* **XP Reward:** `3`
* **Cooldown:** `12h`

{% hint style="info" %}
_Unlike most commands, the cooldown on the `smuggle`command means you can only use it \(successfully\) **once every 12hrs**._
{% endhint %}

## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

Smugglers are given a random assortment of goods that scale with their rank. Those goods can be both legal and illegal, and can be sold on the Market, Black Market, and to other Characters. Depending on their experience, Smugglers will get goods of higher value. Selling them on the Black Market will have a chance of getting them arrested for Smuggling.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Currently, there is only 1 Smuggler character with whom you can interact using the `smuggle`command. This means that you **can't** talk to **Acer** while another player is talking to him._
{% endhint %}
