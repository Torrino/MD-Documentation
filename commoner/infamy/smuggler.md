## Relationship with the Market and other Users:

Smugglers are given a random assortment of goods that scale with their rank. Those goods can be both legal and illegal, and can be sold on the Market, Black Market, and to other Characters. Depending on their experience, Smugglers will get goods of higher value. Selling them on the Black Market will have a chance of getting them arrested for Smuggling.
