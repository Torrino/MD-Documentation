# Preachment Route

Like every other Clergy route, the Preachment route relies on its users earning piety to progress. Specifically, Peachment is supposed to spread the word of God to the people of Rosewood. They have a unique position of holding authority over the people in matters of morality and faith. Some liberties have been taken in terms of hisoric accuracy in order to provide everyone a meaningful and inclusive RP experience. Nevertheless, the Preachment route is supposed to guide and teach the Christian faithful of Rosewood. Any Scribe may join the Preachment Route. The three roles are:

* [Deacon](deacon.md)
* [Priest](priest.md)
* [Archbishop](archbishop.md)
