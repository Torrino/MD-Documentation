# Preachment Route

_They have a unique position of holding authority over the people in matters of morality and faith. Some liberties have been taken in terms of historical accuracy in order to provide everyone a meaningful and inclusive RP experience. Nevertheless, the Preachment route is supposed to guide and teach the Christian faithful of Rosewood._ 

## Joining the Preachment Route

To join the preachment route, you must talk to the **Pastor** NPC in the \#cathedral and spend the appropriate amount of **Piety** which scales with the amount of current active players in each route.

**Base cost:** `50 piety`

_If there is a lack of players in the Preachment route, the base cost will go down automatically.  
The opposite applies if there are too many players in the route, meaning, the price increases._
