# Deacon

## Description:

The Deacon is the first rank of the threefold Christian ministry and is the governor of their respective diaconate, the smallest subdivision of the Catholic authority. Within larger settlements like Rosewood, a single church might have multiple diaconates, all presided by a Deacon, in service to their Parish Priest. However, in smaller settlements, like ones that only have one, a diaconate is synonymous with a parish, and the title is a transitionary period between Scribes and Deacons. Deacons are not considered fully ordained priests and therefore their abilities are limited by law.

## Mechanics:

```javascript
r!convert [other user]
```

`r!convert`  - _Used to Baptize non-Catholics._

#### Additional requirements:

* **Channel:** \#cathedral
* **Necessary tool:** Piety
* **Minimum Stamina:** None
* **XP Reward:** None
* **Buckles Reward:** 50

{% hint style="warning" %}
_r!convert is a command accessible to anyone with at least 4 Intelligence, meaning anyone can convert people to the faith of their own character. However, only the Clergy can convert people to Catholicism. When converted by the Clergy, a user would get an overt `Baptized` role. When a character from an Abrahamic religion is converted to a non-Abrahamic faith, they gain the covert `Apostate` role. Users who are Baptized or Apostates cannot be converted again._
{% endhint %}

```javascript
r!preach
```

`r!preach` - _Used to earn Piety_

#### Additional requirements:

* **Channel:** \#cathedral
* **Necessary tool:** None
* **Minimum Stamina:** 50%
  * **Raw Stamina Cost:** 10
* **XP Reward:** 3
  * **XP Reward Cooldown:** 24h

{% hint style="danger" %}
_Every use of r!preach must be accompanied by an original sermon along with it IC, preferably before the command is used._
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
_r!preach has a chance to fail, depending on your luck, Intelligence, and Charisma._
{% endhint %}

## In-depth guide:

Deacons are the lowest rank within the Preachment route. They inherit every Scribe command and earn a couple of new ones as well. They are basically unordained priests with a few responsibilities including administering the sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist, while also delivering sermons, excluding Mass, and they oversee burials and funerals.
