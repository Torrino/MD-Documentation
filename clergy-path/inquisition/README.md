# Inquisition Route

The Inquisition Route exists in order to enforce the Roman Catholic Dogma onto the citizens of Rosewood. The main goal of the Inquisition is to arrest those who break Church and Morality laws. Additionally, they exist to extract confessions out of those that have been accused of heresy and offer them a chance to repent that way and rejoin the Church. For additional information, and some historical background, follow this [link](https://medievaldiscordrp.com/inquisition/). Any scribe may choose to join the Inquisition, and they have three roles they can progress through:

* [Inquisitor](inquisitor.md)
* [High Inquisitor](high-inquisitor.md)
* [Inquisitor General](inquisitor-general.md)
