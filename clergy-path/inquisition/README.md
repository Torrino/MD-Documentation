# Inquisition Route

_Additionally, they exist to extract confessions out of those that have been accused of heresy and offer them a chance to repent that way and rejoin the Church.   
For additional information, and some historical background, follow_ [_this link_](https://medievaldiscordrp.com/inquisition/) _to a post on our website._ 

## Joining the Inquisition Route

To join the inquisition route, you must talk to the **Pastor** NPC in the \#cathedral and spend the appropriate amount of **Piety** which scales with the amount of current active players in each route.

**Base cost:** `50 piety`

{% hint style="info" %}
_If there is a lack of players in the Inquisition route, the base cost will go down automatically.  
The opposite applies if there are too many players in the route, meaning, the price increases._
{% endhint %}

_Any scribe may choose to join the Inquisition, and they have three roles they can progress through._
