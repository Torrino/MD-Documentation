# Inquisitor General ⚖️

## Description:

The Inquisitor General is the head of the French Inquisition. They are chosen for their loyalty to the Pope, and their devotion to the Catholic faith from among the High Inquisitors of the Kingdom of France. The Inquisitor General answers only to the Pope and is a figure feared throughout Rosewood, from where they operate. The fear they inspire is mostly felt among the commoners, although the rest of the clergy and even the nobility fear the Inquisitor General due to their extraordinary position within France. During Morality trials, if the Archbishop is not available, they will take their place and hold the trial in the Bishop's stead.

## In-depth guide:

High Inquisitors work a lot like regular Inqusitiors, except they have an additional reason to persecute other characters, and that's their r!investigate mechanic. They represent the Inquisitor General's most trusted soldiers and take orders only from them and the Archbishop, however, their loyalty would almost always be to their Inquisitor General. They are the only role that gets a "second name" that's purely for IC \(in character\) use. They will most likely acquire as much piety as they can before spending on the r!investigate mechanic to uncover more potential heretics.
