# High Inquisitor ðŸ”¥

## Description:

High Inquisitors are members of the Inquisitor General's close circle. They are experienced members of the Inquisition and are widely known by an alternative name which is usually part of Abrahamic angel tradition. High Inquisitors are more cunning and can investigate an area to pick up clues regarding someone's religion, be those physical clues or eyewitness accounts.

## In-depth guide:

High Inquisitors work a lot like regular Inqusitiors, except they have an additional reason to persecute other characters, and that's their r!investigate mechanic. They represent the Inquisitor General's most trusted soldiers and take orders only from them and the Archbishop, however, their loyalty would almost always be to their Inquisitor General. They are the only role that gets a "second name" that's purely for IC \(in character\) use. They will most likely acquire as much piety as they can before spending on the r!investigate mechanic to uncover more potential heretics.
