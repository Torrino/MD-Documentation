# High Inquisitor ðŸ”¥

## Description:

High Inquisitors are members of the Inquisitor General's close circle. They are experienced members of the Inquisition and are widely known by an alternative name which is usually part of Abrahamic angel tradition. High Inquisitors are more cunning and can investigate an area to pick up clues regarding someone's religion, be those physical clues or eyewitness accounts.

## In-depth guide:

Inquisitors are the lowest rank of the Inquisition and as such, they work under the orders of other High Inquisitors, the Inquisitor General, or even the Archbishop of Rosewood. They cannot openly question every character, or arrest people based on OOC \(out of character\) knowledge. They may persecute a character if they have been reported by another PC \(player character\), if they have personally heard/witnessed heresy/paganism in action, or if they are commanded by their superiors. Their job is not to kill the enemies of the Church, but to arrest them. However, no one will look twice if they kill a heretic in trying to defend their own lives. Once they have a prisoner, they may offer them the chance to confess their sins and convert to Catholicism. If they accept or are forced, they will become a Confessor and will be let go. If they refuse to confess, the prisoner will be tried at a Morality Trial.
