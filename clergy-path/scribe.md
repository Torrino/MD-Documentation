## In-depth guide:

When joining the clergy, everyone starts off as a Scribe. Scribes are the lowest rank within the Clergy and as such have the least duties. When in the Clergy, people are given access to `r!transcribe` and `r!alm`, allowing them to work for gold, and for piety, respectively. Pietry is what the Clergy uses in order to both progress through the ranks, but also as a type of "spiritual currency" expended in order to use some of their exclusive commands. Thier work is mostly done within the confines of the Cathedral, where they have a Scriptoria. They command no one, and can offer little religious guidance.
