# Scribe ✍️

## Description:

When someone joins the Clergy, they will start out as a Scribe. Scribes will spend their day transcribing and translating certain texts for buckles. Additionally, they are ordered around by the higher ranks in order to accomplish menial tasks.

## Mechanics:

```javascript
r!transcribe
```

`r!transcribe` - _Used to transcribe/translate texts for coin_

#### Additional requirements:

* **Channel:** \#cathedral
* **Necessary tool:** None
* **Minimum Stamina:** 50%
  * **Raw Stamina Cost:** 5 ****
* **XP Reward:** 0
  * **XP Reward Cooldown:** 4h

```javascript
r!alm [amount of buckles]
```

`r!alm` - _Used to trade coins for piety_

#### Additional requirements:

* **Channel:** \#cathedral
* **Necessary tool:** Buckles
* **Minimum Stamina:** None
* **XP Reward:** Scales with the amount of Buckles invested

{% hint style="info" %}
_The Alm command's piety output scales with the amount of buckles sacrificed. However, this also scales with your overal wealth. Meaning a Scribe donating 100 buckles, while he only has 150 will have a hier conversion ratio than an Archbishop who donates 100, while he has 10k buckles._
{% endhint %}

## In-depth guide:

When joining the clergy, everyone starts off as a Scribe. Scribes are the lowest rank within the Clergy and as such have the least duties. When in the Clergy, people are given access to `r!transcribe` and `r!alm`, allowing them to work for gold, and for piety, respectively. Piety is what the Clergy uses in order to both progress through the ranks, but also as a type of "spiritual currency" expended in order to use some of their exclusive commands. Their work is mostly done within the confines of the Cathedral, where they have a Scriptoria. They command no one, and can offer little religious guidance.
