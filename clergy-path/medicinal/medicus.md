# Medicus ðŸ©¸

## Description:

Medici are the base of the Medicinal route within the clergy. They are fully-trained physicians versed in both the four humors, as well as modern French medicine. Most in Rosewood respect them for their healing capabilities and will go to them for any injuries, or illnesses they may come across.

* **Weekly Paycheck:** `40 coin`
* **Rank-up Rewards:** `None`

## Mechanics:

### Aid

{% code title="\#infirmary" %}
```javascript
r!aid
```
{% endcode %}

_Used by Helpers to gain piety through aiding the old and the sick in the infirmary._

* **Minimum Stamina:** 50%
  * **Raw Stamina Cost:** 10
* **Base Reward:** `20-30 piety`
  * **Reward Cooldown:** 24h
  * **Command Cooldown:** 2h

## In-depth guide:

Helpers are the lowest rank within the Medicinal route. In addition to r!alm, they can also earn piety through r!aid. When a character is a helper, their best strategy would be to RP passively and grind piety through the commands at their disposal since they can't make use of Medici's empowered heal command. Their RP is mostly related to healing knowledge and tending to the sick/frail.
