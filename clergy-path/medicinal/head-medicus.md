# Head Medicus ⚕️

## Description:

The Head Medicus is the administrator of the Rosewood Infirmary and the main representative of all Medici within the Capital. They answer directly to the Archbishop in all matters except medicine. Their duties consist of running the infirmary, approving new medicinal practices, studying the human form and its capabilities, as well as leading the Medici of Rosewood. They are well-known within the City, and likely very respected among the commoners as their services are essential, but also pro bono.

* **Weekly Paycheck:** `50 coin`
* **Rank-up Cost:** `500 piety`
* **Rank-up Rewards:** `Medicus Ring`

## Mechanics:

### Invigorate

{% code title="\#infirmary" %}
```javascript
r!invigorate <@user>
```
{% endcode %}

_Used by the Head Medicus in order to physically prepare someone for combat by giving the `Invigorated` role._

* **Piety Cost:** `150 piety`
* **Command Cooldown:** 24h

The `Invigorated` role gives the user a massive stat boost during combat, in both the **attack** and **damage** rolls. After the user's attack, the role disappears.

## In-depth guide:

Helpers are the lowest rank within the Medicinal route. In addition to r!alm, they can also earn piety through r!aid. When a character is a helper, their best strategy would be to RP passively and grind piety through the commands at their disposal since they can't make use of Medici's empowered heal command. Their RP is mostly related to healing knowledge and tending to the sick/frail.
