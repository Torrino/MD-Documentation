# Blacksmith

### Description:

The Blacksmith is one of the oldest professions within Rosewood. At its core, the Blacksmith is a person who takes raw metal and wood and turns it into various tools.

### Mechanics:

#### - r!forge

Just like every other smith, the Blacksmith uses the r!forge command in order to turn simple materials into complex products which can then be used in trading or selling in the Market. This command can only be used in the \#workshops channel, while the Blacksmith has a Hammer equipped.

#### Recipes:

* **Axe** \[3 Iron Bars + 2 Wood\]
* **Hammer** \[1 Iron Bar + 1 Wood\]
* **Nails** \[1 Iron Bar\]
* **Horseshoe** \[2 Iron Bars\]
* **Slaughter Knife** \[1 Iron Bar + 1 Wood\]
* **Hoe** \[2 Iron Bars + 2 Wood\]
* **Steel Bar** \[5 Iron Ore + 10 Charcoal\]
* **Iron Bar** \[5 Iron Ore\]

### Relationship with the Market and other Users:

The Blacksmith can, of course, decide to buy the material they need from the Market, and sell their finished product back to it. However, if a user is attempting to maximize their profit, they should consider trading with other users for both materials and products.

Ideally, a Blacksmith will buy Iron Ore from a Miner, and Wood from a Tree Feller. The Blacksmith can then turn those into ingredients for their recipes. Only Charcoal cannot be acquired through other users and must be bought from the Market directly.

Once the forging process is complete, the Blacksmith would ideally sell their goods to user Tree Fellers \(Axe\), other Smiths \(Hammer\), Farmers \(Hoe and Slaughter Knife\), Butchers \(Slaughter Knife\), Armor and Weaponsmiths \(Steel Bar and Iron Bar\), Carpenters \(Hammer and Nails\) and any horse-owning user \(Horseshoe\).
