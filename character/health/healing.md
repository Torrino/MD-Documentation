# Healing



```text
r!heal (@user)
```

Everyone has access to the `r!heal` command. You may leave out the @user part if you want to heal yourself, or you can tag someone else in order to heal them. The command's efficiency scales with the character's intelligence:

* **0 Intelligence:** `Heal 1 HP`
* **1 Intelligence:** `Heal 5 HP`
* **2 Intelligence:** `Heal 10 HP`
* **3 Intelligence:** `Heal 15 HP`
* **4 Intelligence:** `Heal 20 HP`
* **5 Intelligence:** `Heal 25 HP`
