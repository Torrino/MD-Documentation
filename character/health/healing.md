# Healing



```text
r!heal (@user)
```

Everyone has access to the `r!heal` command. You may leave out the @user part if you want to heal yourself, or you can tag someone else in order to heal them. The command's efficiency scales with the character's intelligence:

* **0 Intelligence:** `Heal 1 HP`
