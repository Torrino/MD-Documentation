# Eating and Drinking

```text
r!eat | r!drink
```

Food and Drink items are now classified as "Consumables", meaning they can be consumed by using the `r!eat/drink` command. Depending on the Consumable consumed, your Character will receive different amounts of health/stamina _\(or other effects for special consumables\)_. 

These commands can be used in any IC channel, and at any time. 

`However, consuming 3 items within 1h will trigger a 4h cooldown before you can eat/drink again, since your character would become full.`

This above is **not** implemented like this. Currently, after your 3rd meal, the 4h cooldown is triggered **regardless** of the time period. _\(last updated 05.6.2021\)_
