# Heritage

Your character's chosen heritage represents their family's ethnic descent. The geographic region chosen tells us where their family comes from before they settled in the Kingdom of France. It allows us to perceive some characteristics related to the people of that place.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Frankia" %}
The region between the Atlantic Ocean, English Channel, Mediterranean and Germania. The people are dominantly white with usually brown eyes and lighter brown hair. There is a strong emphasis on regional unity with the Kingdom of France being a unifying force in the region.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Germania" %}
The territory of the Germanic peoples, from the Baltic sea of the north, to the Venetian plains of the south, between Frankia to the west and the Ruslands to the east. The people are characteristically white, with blond hair and dominantly blue eyes. The region is popular for its feeling of nobility and inheritance of the culture of Rome. The Holy Roman Empire dominates this region.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Italia" %}
The region of the Italian peninsula. Birthplace of the Roman Empire and home to the Papacy. Its people are white, with a slightly darker complexion than their northern neighbors. Their hair is darker brown and their eye color is mostly brown. The birthplace of modern Republicanism and Mercantilism. The region has an aversion towards nobility and prizes wealth above everything.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Hispania" %}
The peninsula south of the Pyrenees Mountains, which separate Iberia from Frankia. The people are a mix between Arab Muslims and European Christians. They are of brown eyes and darker hair. Excellent shipbuilders and sailors, marked by an ongoing religious struggle between the Christians and the Moors. It is a place of war and political change.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Britannia" %}
The isles west of Scandinavia and north-west of Frankia. The population is of a notably paler complexion, with most inhabitants having lighter hair and blue eyes. There is a notable minority of those with green eyes, or ginger hair. Most of the region follows the Church of England. They value their isolationism and usually never meddle with continental affairs.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Scandinavia" %}
The regions of Jutland and everything west of the Ruslands. The birthplace of the Viking culture which shaped Europe. They exist as a society with blue eyes and golden hair. A grand minority still worships some form of paganism, while only a small portion follows the Old Gods. Ferocious warriors who are known for the fame of their pagan ancestors.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Balkans" %}
The region south of the Danube River and surrounded by the Mediterranean, Adriatic and Aegean seas. Their people have a darker complexion than their northern neighbors. They share similarities with both Indo-European peoples and the Nordic peoples. Mostly light hair, and brown eyes. The Balkans are known as the crossroads between West and East, and as such are a frequent battleground.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ruslands" %}
The hills, mountains and plains of the area around the Ural Mountains, above the Black sea, stretching into the Far East. Home to the tribes of what remains of the Rus peoples. They are very Indo-European with a mix of golden and brown hair, and usually brown eyes. They are known for their horsemanship and as the "Gates of Europe" as Eastern invaders usually come to the continent through the lands of the Rus, like the Huns, Cumans, and now, the Mongols. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Maghreb" %}
The land of northern Africa, the southern shores of the Mediterranean. Home to many Islamic kingdoms. It is the land of the Arabs, and home to one of the most powerful entities in the world, the Tunisian kingdom. The people are known for being of a dark hair and complexion, as well as their brown eyes.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Near East" %}
The land between Africa, Europe and Asia and the Mediterranean Sea. Home to the Arabic people. Mostly brown eyes and brown hair. Home to the Kingdom of Jerusalem and is dominantly Muslim. The gateway for the Silk Road, between Europe and the Far East.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Far East" %}
The land east of the Ruslands, unknown to most people and almost fairy tale-like to the commoners. There are stories of their Empires and armies which could reach 100.000 strong. They hold many heathen religions, and are dominantly Asian. Almost no one makes the journey from one side to the other permanently, and as such is a land only known to the best of Merchants.
{% endtab %}

### 1. Only bonus lore

> _Your character's heritage should play almost no part in their development, since their Region of birth is something different entirely. All characters are born in France, and may only trace their heritage to distant regions. This is in order to preserve some realism._

{% hint style="danger" %}
_Despite drawing their descent from a certain region, your character will speak Common by default, as they were born in France, somewhere near Rosewood._
{% endhint %}
