# Gender

### 1. **Characters can only be male or female**

> _While people today can identify with many genders, gender theory wasn't even a distant concept in the 13th century. Therefore, in order to uphold medieval realism, we enforce the choice between the two binary genders, male and female; male being related to man, and female related to women._

### 2. Gender characteristics

> _While men and women typically had very precise roles in society that were determined by their gender, in MD we both recognize this, but try to provide enough freedom for people to experience the full Medieval Discord experience, regardless of their gender. As such, gender roles remain, however, within Rosewood, the Capital of the Kingdom of France and the setting for MD's RP, women are on equal footing as men. Some discrepancies still exist, like within the Church, but the overall public perception is that there is no reason to belittle the other half of the population for something as trivial as gender._
