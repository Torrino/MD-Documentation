# Character Creator

The Character Creator is Medieval Discord's solution to character creation. It enables users to create a singular OC \(original character\) within MD's universe with certain identifiable traits that help them interact with other characters and the world around them. No user may engage in RP, or chat OOC \(out of character\) until they have made a character in the Character Creator.

Every OC has their:

1. Name
2. Gender
3. Age
4. Religion
5. Heritage
6. Region
7. Path
8. SICS Stats
