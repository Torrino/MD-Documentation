# SICS Stats

### 1. Balancing your Stats

> _Every character is defined by their Strength, Intelligence, Charisma, and Stamina. When making your character, you will by default have 10 points to spend on these 4 Stats. All 10 must be spent, no more, no less. The lowest number a Stat can have during creation is 0, and the highest is 5. However, through RP that Stat may go over 5, or under 0._

### 2. Strength

> _Strength is the most useful Stat for combat-oriented characters. It represents the physical fitness and force of a character. It has a direct impact on your damage, and health, and also plays a role in your carry weight. Finally, characters with 0 Strength are unable to participate in combat effectively, and will always lose._

### 3. Intelligence

> _Intelligence is useful for Clergy characters. It represents the mental fortitude as well as knowledge of a character. It directly impacts literacy, seeing through lies and XP gain._

### 4. Charisma

> _Charisma is a character's speechcraft. The higher the Stat, the more charismatic they are. Useful for criminal characters. It directly impacts lying and prices on the Market._

### 5. Stamina

> _Stamina is a character's ability to use commands. It is likely the most important Stat, as it is used in Combat and in using other IC roles, as well as your carry weight._
