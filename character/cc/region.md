# Region

Your character's region represents their region of birth, as in, which settlement they were born in.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Rosewood" %}
Rosewood is the Capital City of the Kingdom of France, and where the King resides. It is the most advanced settlement in the West, and is renowned for its devotion to knowledge and progress, as well for its wealth and trade. The most skilled craftsmen and artisans make a living here, close to the King.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Forechester" %}
Forechester is a large town next to Rosewood. It is regarded as its sister in local folklore and is well-known for its devotion to trade and leisure. Forechester has extremely lively streets, and a busy market compared to other towns, and has a system of administration modeled after Rosewood, with a Mayor elected by local council. Much of Forechester's residents end up being Clergy members in Rosewood, as the religious fervor of the town is strong, but the Capital offers better opportunities to Catholic priests.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Shelby" %}
Shelby is a town to Rosewood's north and is known for being a major garrison if its former Imperial Army. As such, it has a history of discipline which still translates to this day into their Town Watch. Both sons and daughters are taught to fight at a young age and they translate that well into experience for serving in the Kingdom's many Watches and Guards.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Kington" %}
Kington is the farthest town from Rosewood, located to its East, but it is also a very young small town. Since it is in its infancy, crime is rampant. Drifters from Kington are widely regarded as vagrants, thieves, and bandits by the rest of Egirth. It doesn't help that most of its most notorious villains come to Rosewood to fuel its large gang population.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Frey" %}
Frey is the largest village in Rosewood's proximity and looks up to the City as a child would to its parent. The people of Frey are known for their hard work and dedication. Due to their proximity to the Capital, most prospectful youths make the journey to ply their craft in the City, rather than stay at home.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Village" %}
Characters from this region are known as simple peasants or villeins who are trying to improve their life by moving to the City, often accepting any kind of work. It is not unheard of that a villein has an impact on Rosewood's society, but most of them end up being beggars in the slums.  
The villages that villeins usually come from are:

* Hornnet
* Priorton
* Anderton
* Riche
* Maye
* Verva
* Ibby
* Charleston
* Springvale
* Philanset
* Hwetbask
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Your character may be born in one of these places, but you get to decide when they moved to Rosewood. It may have been immediately after they were born, or perhaps immediately after your created the OC. You have the freedom to craft your character's backstory; within the limits of the parameters you've chosen, of course.
