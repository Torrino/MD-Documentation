# Paths

Paths are characters' career options within MD which will define their profession. At the beginning, you may either start your character off a Citizen in the Commoner Path and then choose your actual path later on, or you may immediately join the Clergy or Military. By default, everyone starts off as a Citizen and can they choose their Path.

##  Commoner Path

Commoners are Citizens, Artisans, Criminals, and Leisuremen. By default, unless stated otherwise, every character will start off on the Commoner Path, as a Citizen. If they decide they want to remain in the Commoner Path, then they have three Routes to choose from:

* [Fame Route](../../commoner/fame/)
* [Infamy Route](../../commoner/infamy/)
* [Service Route](../../commoner/service/)

## Clergy Path

The Clergy are members of the Catholic Church in Rosewood and are there to lead the religious of the City. Once in the Clergy, after leveling up, one may choose to progress down their preferred route:

* [Preachment Route](../../clergy/preachment/)
* [Inquisition Route](../../clergy/inquisition/)
* [Medicinal Route](../../clergy/medicinal/)

{% hint style="danger" %}
_Characters who are married cannot join the Clergy._
{% endhint %}

## Military Path

Those in the Military Path may expect frequent combat. A person may choose between two options:

* [City Watch Route](../../military/city-watch/)
* [Sellsword Route](../../military/sellsword.md)

## Majesty Path

The Majesty Path is exclusive to the best Certified Members of the server, and represent the nobility, giving character a certain gravitas and multiple IC responsibilities. This Path, above all requires good knowledge of the conventions of the server, as well as some insight/interest for the Lore. There are two Routes for Majesty characters:

* [Lesser Nobility](../../majesty-path/lesser-nobility.md)
* [High Nobility](../../majesty-path/high-nobility.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
You have the ability to switch Paths by quitting them. However, once left, you may never return to them, so choose wisely and make the most of your chosen Path.
{% endhint %}
