{% tab title="Roman Catholicism" %}
Roman Catholicism is the main Western branch of Christianity that emerged after the schism of 1087 after the First Council of Rosewood. It is distinguishable by certain doctrines and beliefs:

* Headed by the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, who is chosen from amongst the Cardinals to represent Catholicism. The Pope is believed to be Vicar of Christ and therefore infallible.
* Belief in the Holy Trinity consisting of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
* Devotion to the Virgin Mary, who they believe gave birth to Christ without intercourse, and ascended to Heaven where she is an intermediary between God and his people.
* Belief in transubstantiation, where during Mass when the Priest repeats Christ's words during the Last Supper, the bread and wine take on the traits of Christ's Body and Blood although not changing their outward appearance. Eucharist remains one of the most important rituals and is encouraged at least once per week, on Sundays.
* Celibacy is considered virtuous, and obligatory in the Clergy. Both men and women may become priests, although only celibate men may become Cardinals and Popes.
* You can only be Baptized once. Usually the ritual is performed on Sundays, with the person being baptized dressed in white, and with kin there as witnesses or godparents.
* Belief that Priests can administer the Sacrament of Penance or Confession to those baptized, granting the forgiveness of Christ to those who confess their sins and repent for them.
* The ritual of Confirmation at the age of reason, which is at seven years old when a person officially joins the Catholic Church.
* Belief that marriage is eternal and that it can only be annulled by Archbishops and the Pope in extreme circumstances. Additionally, marriages transcend both life and death, so widows and widowers may only remarry with the permission of the Pope.
* Belief that vows to the Lord \(like joining a Holy Order\) are to be held in the highest regard and that breaking them may result in eternal damnation.
* Belief in Extreme Unction and the Last Rites given to those gravely ill or those about to die.
* Veneration of Saints and Martyrs

### 2. A name must be accurate to the culture

> _Firstly, parents would make sure the name they gave their child was one that corresponded with their gender. Unisex names were not common, but they were present nevertheless. Following traditional roles in society, boys' names would have something to do with courage, wisdom, strength, while girls' names would have some connection to beauty, humility, and wisdom. The names of saints and Biblical figures were particularly popular. In addition to those conventions, names must keep with the language of the region the person is born into. The language spoken in MD's Kingdom of France is closest to Anglo-Norman. So names that take influence from Anglo-Saxon culture, as well as Norman-Latin names, are acceptable._
