{% tab title="Roman Catholicism" %}
Roman Catholicism is the main Western branch of Christianity that emerged after the schism of 1087 after the First Council of Rosewood. Its origin is traced to the Sacrifice of Christ and it is part of Christianity which is an Abrahamic religion, sharing its lore with Judaism and Islam. It is distinguishable by certain doctrines and beliefs:

* Headed by the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, who is chosen from amongst the Cardinals to represent Catholicism. The Pope is believed to be Vicar of Christ and therefore infallible.
* Belief in the Holy Trinity consisting of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
* Devotion to the Virgin Mary, who they believe gave birth to Christ without intercourse, and ascended to Heaven where she is an intermediary between God and his people.
* Belief in transubstantiation, where during Mass when the Priest repeats Christ's words during the Last Supper, the bread and wine take on the traits of Christ's Body and Blood although not changing their outward appearance. Eucharist remains one of the most important rituals and is encouraged at least once per week, on Sundays.
* Celibacy is considered virtuous, and obligatory in the Clergy. Both men and women may become priests, although only celibate men may become Cardinals and Popes.
* You can only be Baptized once. Usually the ritual is performed on Sundays, with the person being baptized dressed in white, and with kin there as witnesses or godparents.
* Belief that Priests can administer the Sacrament of Penance or Confession to those baptized, granting the forgiveness of Christ to those who confess their sins and repent for them.
* The ritual of Confirmation at the age of reason, which is at seven years old when a person officially joins the Catholic Church.
* Belief that marriage is eternal and that it can only be annulled by Archbishops and the Pope in extreme circumstances. Additionally, marriages transcend both life and death, so widows and widowers may only remarry with the permission of the Pope.
* Belief that vows to the Lord \(like joining a Holy Order\) are to be held in the highest regard and that breaking them may result in eternal damnation.
* Belief in Extreme Unction and the Last Rites given to those gravely ill or those about to die.
* Veneration of Saints and Martyrs
* Those unbaptized, sinners, and the excommunicated will be punished through Hell for all eternity.

{% tab title="Judaism" %}
Judaism is the oldest Abrahamic religion and finds its origins in Moses' Exodus from Egypt and his leadership and guidance of the Israelites until they are given the land of Canaan. Judaism does not have a head of its faith, instead the role of "leading the flock" is given to individual Rabbis. Unlike Christianity, Judaism rejects the notions of the Trinity and sees it as a pagan perversion of God's oneness. It then follows that Jesus is not seen as the son of God, but just a regular man who could not absolve sin, nor rise from the dead. While in Christianity, the belief in Christ and his teachings replaced the notion of Jewish Legalism, in Judaism, there is a sense of strict adherence to the Code and Word of God, therefore the Commandments and Jewish Laws are seen as divine.

The Jewish faith rejects the idea of the Original Sin, that all men are born sinful and must instead seek entrance into heaven through Communion and Jesus. Instead, all men are born neutral, and are given the ability of free will to determine their own destiny on whether they will resist the temptations and sins of the world, or succumb to them.

There is a great focus on earthly life in Judaism, as it is the part of the world, mortal can have an impact on. God is seen as eternally just and therefore there is no great need to discuss what comes after. Generally, Hell is not seen as an eternal punishment, and neither are there specific places for specific punishments. Mostly, Judaism believe that Hell is personal to the individual and might even exist in the same plane as Heaven, represented by a soul's distance from God. Unlike Christianity and Islam, Judaism allows Gentiles \(non-Jews\) to enter Heaven as long as they have lived a moral life.

Jews hold a unique place in Medieval society. They are regarded as wise Scholars, effective legislators, and powerful bankers, as Catholic laws do not allow the charge of interest on loans. Due to their uniquely prestigious position is society, during hardships they mostly go unaffected and as a result are frequently blamed for causing times of crisis. For this reason, some Kingdoms order large-scale exoduses of their population. In Rosewood, they always have a home and are appreciated for their skills, and protected by Law from religious persecution.

{% tab title="Islam" %}
Islam is the youngest Abrahamic religion. It originated in 622 when Mohammad made the journey from Mecca to Medina. Like Judaism, it rejects the idea of the Holy Trinity and believes in God being a single, all-powerful creator. Islam doesn't have a clerical structure that is meant to guide man towards God or administer sacraments. Like Judaism, their clergy usually has a mentoring, teaching, and advisory role within local communities. Individual Imams are the leaders of Islam for small groups of Muslims. However, there are attempts at bridging the gap between secular and divine through titles like Caliph or Amir al-Mu'minin which try to claim both earthly and clerical leadership over their respective regions, but the Islamic world as a whole.

Jesus is considered a prophet, however Islam rejects the idea that he is the son of God, or that he is part of God. However, Muslims do believe that Mary gave a miracle birth to him, but he could not absolve sin, nor return from the dead. Additionally, Islam does not apply the Original Sin to all of mankind. The entire myth of the Fall is seen as a small misstep in the life of Adam and Eve. Something that does not reflect on the rest of mankind.

Islam holds the Qur'an as the final revelation and the absolute word of God written by the Prophet. As such it is not to be changed and is to be followed without fail. Most of the lore is the same though the names may differ. Most famously a point of difference between Judeo-Christian theology and Islamic is the idea of God's Covenant with Abraham. For Jews and Christians, the inheritor of God's Covenant was Isaac, while for Muslims, the inheritor was Ishmael, Abraham's second son.

While Islam does not allow non-believers into Heaven, it makes exceptions for Jews and Christians who lived before the time of Mohammad, and it makes exception for those who live morally good lives, but have not had the opportunity or knowledge to accept Islam. All those who know the word of God, but reject it, will be sent to Hell for all eternity. However, Islam does allow redemption from Hell in the case of some sins.

Muslims are regarded as the keepers of ancient knowledge. Baghdad, a powerful city in the crescent hold the House of Wisdom where the acumen of Islamic innovation is stored. Through war and trade, this knowledge is slowly making its way to Rosewood, as are many Muslims from Mesopotamia, but mostly from the Moorish lands after being persecuted by the Christian Kings of Iberia. In Rosewood, their freedom is guaranteed by the Legal Code, and they are seen as wealthy merchants and wise scholars.

### 2. A name must be accurate to the culture

> _Firstly, parents would make sure the name they gave their child was one that corresponded with their gender. Unisex names were not common, but they were present nevertheless. Following traditional roles in society, boys' names would have something to do with courage, wisdom, strength, while girls' names would have some connection to beauty, humility, and wisdom. The names of saints and Biblical figures were particularly popular. In addition to those conventions, names must keep with the language of the region the person is born into. The language spoken in MD's Kingdom of France is closest to Anglo-Norman. So names that take influence from Anglo-Saxon culture, as well as Norman-Latin names, are acceptable._
