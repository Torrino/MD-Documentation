# Name

### 1. **Characters can only have a first name**

> _Most people during the time had only one name to identify themselves. Their "last name" would likely just be either the name of an ancestor, be it a grandparent or parent \(Johnson, Fitzgerald\) or the name of their craft, or their family's craft \(Smith, Fisher\). Some variations may exist, like taking the names of the places they were born in \(Frey, Rose\), or from natural marker/phenomenon distinct to their place of origin \(Rivers, Summers\). Rarely will anyone have a more complex last name which one could consider a House name. Instead, lowborn commoners, and citizens of Rosewood will almost always only be refer to by their first name._

### 2. A name must be accurate to the culture

> _Firstly, parents would make sure the name they gave their child was one that corresponded with their gender. Unisex names were not common, but they were present nevertheless. Following traditional roles in society, boys' names would have something to do with courage, wisdom, strength, while girls' names would have some connection to beauty, humility, and wisdom. The names of saints and Biblical figures were particularly popular. In addition to those conventions, names must keep with the language of the region the person is born into. The language spoken in MD's Kingdom of France is closest to Anglo-Norman. So names that take influence from Anglo-Saxon culture, as well as Norman-Latin names, are acceptable._
