# Name

1. Characters can only have a first name

> _Most people during the time had only one name to identify themselves. Their "last name" would likely just be either the name of an ancestor, be it a grandparent or parent \(Johnson, Fitzgerald\) or the name of their craft, or their family's craft \(Smith, Fisher\). Some variations may exist, like taking the names of the places they were born in \(Frey, Rose\), or from natural marker/phenomenon distinct to their place of origin \(Rivers, Summers\). Rarely will anyone have a more complex last name which one could consider a House name. Instead, lowborn commoners, and citizens of Rosewood will almost always only be refer to by their first name._
