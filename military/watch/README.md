# City Watch Route

The Watch are the successors of the Imperial Watch that was in place during the time of the Sirius/Neo-Carolingian Empire. During the Imperial Age, they were a lesser part of the Imperial Army and were known as Imperials. However, their reputation was always higher within their respective settlements. Previously, men and women could be transferred from one location to another during their tenure as Watch officers. After the dissolution of the Empire members of the Watch are beholden only to their liege lord, and the settlement they've been born in. Cities and Towns have an organized Watch structure, modeled lightly after the Imperial Watch, smaller settlements are not beholden to such restrictions. In most cases, the chief of the Watch is the Bailiff, who answers either to the Marshal or directly to the liege lord of the settlement. The Watch's equipment is provided by the liege lord, and they have uniforms to distinguish them from the rest of the citizenry. In Rosewood's case, they use repurposed Imperial clothing, dyed red, representing the Rose of Rosewood. However, they do wear blue bands around their arms to indicate their rank.

The City Watch have access to the `r!kit` command that allows them to collect their **kit** from the City's armory within the Guardhouse. Once their arms and armor are lost, the kit cannot be issued again without the Bailiff's express permission.

In order to progress through the Watch, you will have to speak to the **Trainer** NPC and request a promotion from him if you've acquired enough experience.
