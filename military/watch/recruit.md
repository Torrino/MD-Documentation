# Recruit

## Description:

Recruits are the first rank of the City Watch. They are the men and women of Rosewood who have chosen to take part in their duty to their City and their King and uphold his laws. Their duties consist of training, escorting, and learning from higher ranks. Once they have proven their devotion to the Watch, they will be eligible for a promotion. Before that, their duties and privileges are limited.

## In-depth guide:

Due to being the first in a long string of ranks, the Recruit rank offers no bonus mechanics or specific RP to the character. However, it gives users time to acclimate to the way the Military works in VEA. It is no longer about fighting big battles or defending against outside threats. The Military now is comprised out of those willing to fight for a living, but in the name of the City of Rosewood. Consider Recruit to be a trial version of the Watch. A time when you may train, spar, make connections before the real work begins. Recruits are offered no kits, no paycheck, and do not earn xp. _**You will need to send a number of messages IC before you are eligible for a promotion with the Trainer NPC.**_
