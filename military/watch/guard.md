# Guard üèπ

## Description:

Guards are the main fighting force of the City Watch. They are the men and women called upon when there is a disturbance within Rosewood. Their main task is conflict resolution by way of speechcraft, force, or arrest. Peace is maintained by patrolling the streets of the City or by guarding key points like gates, notable buildings, the Market, or the Main Square among other places. While Pickets are the first to get their uniforms, Guards are the first to get their stripes. To distinguish rank within the Watch, a practice inherited from the Imperial Watch, members wear colored cloth bands, called stripes. Guards have one blue stripe around their left bicep.
