description: The most basic ways for your character to earn an income in MD.

# Income

{% code title="\#shops \| \#workshops" %}
```javascript
r!work
```
{% endcode %}

_The bot randomly picks a reply out of a few already existing ones and sends it in the channel where you've used the command. What the bot sends, happens in in-character and that's how your characters earns a small amount of buckles \(those buckles get added automatically to your coin balance\)._

## Paychecks

Depending on the Path or Route, your character may additionally receive a daily/weekly/monthly paycheck. Paychecks are collected mainly in the **\#bank** using the following command:

{% code title="\#bank" %}
```javascript
r!paycheck
```
{% endcode %}

If for example a Deacon has a weekly paycheck then they have to go to the \#bank channel and use the above command to receive their income.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your character will **not** receive any money if they don't use the paycheck command. Additionally, once your paycheck is ready \(i.e. once a week\), you won't be eligible for the next paycheck until you collect your current one. Paychecks do **not** stack.
{% endhint %}
