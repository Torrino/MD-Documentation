# Money

## _The Currency_

The currency used in **Medieval Discord** and the **in-character** world which is acknowledged by all characters within **Rosewood** is **1 Buckle** or many **Buckles.**

The money your character owns can either be in `Coin`or in your `Bank`.

## Money in Coin

This is the money your character has **on them**, meaning, this is literally the coin your character is carrying in their pockets. Your character always has access to money in coin and can use them at any time for whatever reason. 

Here's an overview of what you can do with your **money in coin**:

* _Used for spending when buying items, doing quests, etc._ 
* _Can be stolen by other players_ 
* _Can be lost as punishment when making wrong decisions, random events, etc._ 
* _Can be stored in the bank at any time using the command `deposit` in the bank channel._ 

## Money in Bank

* _Usually safe from being stolen or lost..._usually_._
* _Automatically taxed by the government \(unless you're avoiding taxes\)_
* _Any amount can be withdrawn using the command `!withdraw`_
