# Helper üõèÔ∏è

## Description:

Helpers are the initiates of the Medicinal route. They are members of the clergy in training to become fully-fledged Medici. While Rosewood does rely on older healing methods, most of the best Medici use [Leech Elisabeth Ashyver's texts on medicine](https://medievaldiscordrp.com/libri-medicinae/), compiled from her studies on Arabic, Roman, and Ancient Greek medicine. Helpers are mostly there to tend to the old and sick in the infirmary, while the larger tasks fall onto the Medici.

* **Weekly Paycheck:** `20 coin`
* **Rank-up Rewards:** `Medicus Robes`

## Mechanics:

### Aid

{% code title="\#infirmary" %}
```javascript
r!aid
```
{% endcode %}

_Used by Helpers to gain piety through aiding the old and the sick in the infirmary._

* **Minimum Stamina:** 50%
  * **Raw Stamina Cost:** 10
* **Base Reward:** `20-30 piety`
  * **Reward Cooldown:** 24h
  * **Command Cooldown:** 2h

## In-depth guide:

Helpers are the lowest rank within the Medicinal route. In addition to r!alm, they can also earn piety through r!aid. When a character is a helper, their best strategy would be to RP passively and grind piety through the commands at their disposal since they can't make use of Medici's empowered heal command. Their RP is mostly related to healing knowledge and tending to the sick/frail.
