# Medicus ðŸ©¸

## Description:

Medici are the base of the Medicinal route within the clergy. They are fully-trained physicians versed in both the four humors, as well as modern French medicine. Most in Rosewood respect them for their healing capabilities and will go to them for any injuries, or illnesses they may come across.

When you reach the Medicus rank, your character will gain the Leech title.

## In-depth guide:

Medici are valued for their powerful healing command. While technically everyone has access to it, the Medici's heal is much more powerful, even in its weakest form. Like in most roles before this one, Intelligence is a highly prized SICS stat within the clergy, especially in the Medicinal route due to its direct effect on the heal command. Medici will spend most of their time in the infirmary but may be called upon to visit residential areas, battlefields, or elsewhere. They are also employed to care for the pregnant women of Rosewood and help them deliver their children, greatly reducing both mother and child mortality rates within the City.
